# Truth Social Source

This repository contains an automatically updated dump of Truth Social's source code (reskinned Mastodon). Everything is in the [`source`](/source) folder.

Because Truth Social is reskinned [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)), Truth Social is legally required under the AGPL to release their source code. They don't make it easy to browse, though. This repository changes that.

Future improvements:

- [ ] Make it easier to diff with Mastodon.

**To make it unambiguous: I did not write the code in the `source/` folder. I am not associated with Truth Social in any way. This is to help with research, investigations, and analysis.**
